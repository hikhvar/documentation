Technical Story: [Document supported Kubernetes versions| https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/issues/83]
Related Documentation: https://docs.stackable.tech/agent/limitations.html

== Context and Problem Statement

Multiple new versions of Kubernetes are released every year. Different Kubernetes components (including kubectl) will only support a limited number of versions, as mandated by the https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/[Version Skew Policy]. We need to define the supported Kubernetes versions. 

== Decision Drivers

* customers might be slowly adopting new Kubernetes releases: customers might be lagging behind in their Kubernetes clusters
* tech is fast moving: major Kubernetes improvements are released multiple times a year
* How can we upgrade the Kubernetes we run without customer intervention?

== Considered Options

* follow Kubernetes Version Skew Policy 
* support any Kubernetes Version for n months
* identify Stackable's long-term-support versions of Kubernetes

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].
